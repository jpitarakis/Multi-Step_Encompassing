This folder contains the data and code used in the Application of the paper. The data file is in excel 
format and named WB_HCPI_Q.xlsx. The main program file that replicates results is Application_HCPIQ.m. 
The two key files that are called are "recursive_hstep_fast.m" which computes the recursive forecast 
errors associated with the competing models and "pred_encompass_dnorm.m" which implements the test statistic 
and outputs its pvalues. The remainder files allow for alternative long run variance estimators.
